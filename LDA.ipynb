I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and after several attempts of giving my full name, nothing came up in their system. I gave my social and the rep said the account popped up but DID NOT tell me that the account was under someone elses name and continued to let me make a payment. The payment was for {$120.00}. Confirmation number-XXXX. After realizing it was not my account, I called back to get my money back and inform them of the mistake. I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them. After contacting them i was again told that i can not get my money back. The issue im having is this representative at XXXX XXXX played blind to obvious fraud and let an innocent person make a payment on someone elses debt and i want my money back.  \n",

       "      <td>I purchased a new vehicle and financed it with a loan from USAA. I was confused about the specifics of a 0.5 % APR discount if I went to a dealer who particiapted in the USAA car buying program. I contacted the bank by phone to confirm the details of the specific discount. I confirmed verbally on a recorded line prior to purchasing my vehicle that I only needed to contact a auto dealer, verify that the dealer participated in the car buying program with USAA, then purchase a vehicle from that dealer and the 0.5 % APR discount would be applied to the rate of my loan. USAA has no physical bank branch locations so I had to rely on a verbal confirmation on my phone call. \\n\\nI went and purchased my vehicle in mid XX/XX/XXXX. I then received a APR billing form noting that I was being charged without the 0.5 % APR discount applied. \\n\\nI called USAA on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX approximately XXXX XXXX  until XXXX to attempt to sort it out. \\n\\nThe bank let me talk to an executive dispute resolution person named XXXX. XXXX reviewed the recorded call when I called USAA to clarify the details of the program and he admitted to me that USAA had made an error and incorrectly explained the details that I needed to follow to qualify for the loan. He explained that I was misled and that USAA would fix the issue for me. He took some time to confirm the details with his boss before coming back on the line with me. He explained that USAA would require me to pay the same fixed amount for a monthly payment but they would reduce the APR with the rate that I was told I would qualify for which was ~2.8ish % not the 3.3ish % that I was incorrectly charged. \\n\\nHe explained that I would continue to pay my fixed monthly amount but that the principle of the loan would be paid off earlier thus saving me the money I should have gotten because I would have paid off the loan earlier and saved the difference in interest that I was owed. \\n\\nHe explained that I should receive a letter in mid XX/XX/XXXX detailing the specifics of this remedy. I specifically asked about the detailed amount I would save and that this I specifically asked that they would reduce the total loan interest rate and that they provide me written details of this remedy. XXXX confirmed to me on the phone that they would honor the 0.5 % decrease in my rate because the person I had talked to prior at USAA had misspoke and given me incorrect information. XXXX did explain the details of the USAA car buying program and what I would have to do to qualify for the discount in the future. \\n\\nUltimately this resolution would shorten the life of the loan since I will be paying the old monthly payment at the 3.3ish percent over the life of the loan but the loan amount will remain the same. I did confirm that I would still be able to pay off the loan early still. \\n\\nI waited until XX/XX/XXXX after I got a letter from USAA rejecting XXXX XXXX   internal request. I contacted USAA and a representative told me that it was a sort of clerical error and that they would resubmit the paperwork through the proper channels. I stated to them that I was working on the assumption that what XXXX told me still stands on XXXX XXXX and USAA will have to figure out how to make it work for me. \\n\\nI received an email decline notice on or around XX/XX/XXXX from USAA. I called and spoke to a representative at USAA again and was told they would not honor the previous statements. I asked to speak to an executive resolutions specialist and was sent to talk with XXXX from their executive resolutions team. XXXX and I spoke and he reviewed the previous phone calls and notes in their system. He explained he would advocate for me and get the issue taken care of for me. He said he would resubmit and get back to me. \\n\\nXXXX and I talked again around XX/XX/XXXX, he explained it was not working and he was excalating to the car buying service and I should expect to hear back. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received word that XXXX was sending something to the USAA advocacy team for me. He asked them to contact me. I have not received contact from Advocacy but did receive a call from a car buying service where I explained that this seemed to be a USAA issue and that they should contact USAA for details. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted USAA through their secure messaging app telling them I had not heard from XXXX and that I would file a complaint if I didnt hear back this week. Now on XX/XX/XXXX I'm filing.</td>\n",

Their letter stated in part, they were unable to approve my application because they could not verify my SSN I provided in the application against information they obtain from the credit-reporting agency. I am confused because Comenitybank in fact did obtain my Social Security number and cause three negative impact : ( 1 ) A Hard Inquiry posted on XXXX which will stay on my credit report for 2 years and ( 2 ) A Hard Inquiry which caused my credit score to drop by 2 points ( 3 ) Both activity caused me extreme distress.

Therefore, If I or a criminal give out correct but limited information EXCLUDING my social security number ( part/whole ) Comenitybank automatically thinks its XXXX XXXX and preform a Hard/Soft Inquiries for such items as a loan, mortgage, cars, credit cards, etc. Does Comenitybank/XXXX   have my signature on file next to my SSN to release information to all 3 credit bureaus? Which Consent Category do I fixed in above? I need to be compensated for extreme distress. \\n\\n( 2 ) In Comenitys letter dated XXXX, they told me my credit score as of XXXX which is additional proof they did obtain my correct SSN.

       "21957  I purchased a new vehicle and financed it with a loan from USAA. I was confused about the specifics of a 0.5 % APR discount if I went to a dealer who particiapted in the USAA car buying program. I contacted the bank by phone to confirm the details of the specific discount. I confirmed verbally on a recorded line prior to purchasing my vehicle that I only needed to contact a auto dealer, verify that the dealer participated in the car buying program with USAA, then purchase a vehicle from that dealer and the 0.5 % APR discount would be applied to the rate of my loan. USAA has no physical bank branch locations so I had to rely on a verbal confirmation on my phone call. \\n\\nI went and purchased my vehicle in mid XX/XX/XXXX. I then received a APR billing form noting that I was being charged without the 0.5 % APR discount applied. \\n\\nI called USAA on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX approximately XXXX XXXX  until XXXX to attempt to sort it out. \\n\\nThe bank let me talk to an executive dispute resolution person named XXXX. XXXX reviewed the recorded call when I called USAA to clarify the details of the program and he admitted to me that USAA had made an error and incorrectly explained the details that I needed to follow to qualify for the loan. He explained that I was misled and that USAA would fix the issue for me. He took some time to confirm the details with his boss before coming back on the line with me. He explained that USAA would require me to pay the same fixed amount for a monthly payment but they would reduce the APR with the rate that I was told I would qualify for which was ~2.8ish % not the 3.3ish % that I was incorrectly charged. \\n\\nHe explained that I would continue to pay my fixed monthly amount but that the principle of the loan would be paid off earlier thus saving me the money I should have gotten because I would have paid off the loan earlier and saved the difference in interest that I was owed. \\n\\nHe explained that I should receive a letter in mid XX/XX/XXXX detailing the specifics of this remedy. I specifically asked about the detailed amount I would save and that this I specifically asked that they would reduce the total loan interest rate and that they provide me written details of this remedy. XXXX confirmed to me on the phone that they would honor the 0.5 % decrease in my rate because the person I had talked to prior at USAA had misspoke and given me incorrect information. XXXX did explain the details of the USAA car buying program and what I would have to do to qualify for the discount in the future. \\n\\nUltimately this resolution would shorten the life of the loan since I will be paying the old monthly payment at the 3.3ish percent over the life of the loan but the loan amount will remain the same. I did confirm that I would still be able to pay off the loan early still. \\n\\nI waited until XX/XX/XXXX after I got a letter from USAA rejecting XXXX XXXX   internal request. I contacted USAA and a representative told me that it was a sort of clerical error and that they would resubmit the paperwork through the proper channels. I stated to them that I was working on the assumption that what XXXX told me still stands on XXXX XXXX and USAA will have to figure out how to make it work for me. \\n\\nI received an email decline notice on or around XX/XX/XXXX from USAA. I called and spoke to a representative at USAA again and was told they would not honor the previous statements. I asked to speak to an executive resolutions specialist and was sent to talk with XXXX from their executive resolutions team. XXXX and I spoke and he reviewed the previous phone calls and notes in their system. He explained he would advocate for me and get the issue taken care of for me. He said he would resubmit and get back to me. \\n\\nXXXX and I talked again around XX/XX/XXXX, he explained it was not working and he was excalating to the car buying service and I should expect to hear back. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received word that XXXX was sending something to the USAA advocacy team for me. He asked them to contact me. I have not received contact from Advocacy but did receive a call from a car buying service where I explained that this seemed to be a USAA issue and that they should contact USAA for details. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted USAA through their secure messaging app telling them I had not heard from XXXX and that I would file a complaint if I didnt hear back this week. Now on XX/XX/XXXX I'm filing.   \n",
       "16615  On XXXX XXXX I received a settlement letter to settle and payoff a credit account with Barclays if payment is received by XX/XX/2019 from their attorney. The amount was paid in full on XX/XX/2019 as stated in the letter. The letter stated that it would be fully compromised and settled. \\nThe letter I paid and settled and account with the attorney as agreed. I sent a request to the credit reporting agency to update the file and on 2 occasions they return at report stating that there was a remaining balance of {$540.00}. It was reported XX/XX/2019, XX/XX/2019 and again in XX/XX/2019. \\nThe legal document states that the account would be fully settled and compromised. Meaning there would not be a balance owed. Submitted the request to the credit reporting agency has resulted in no change and basically a repeated inaccurate report resent. Reports are supposed to be accurate and I have continued to receive an inaccurate credit report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "6249   Mid XXXX I received a collections letter from Capio Partners LLC, XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXXXXXX, XXXX, TX XXXX regarding an XXXX bill of {$160.00} incurred about 5 years ago which was paid through the doctor 's office ( XXXX XXXX ) {$200.00} for XXXX before the service was performed. However, a few months later I recieved a bill for the same XXXX. I called the XXXX service and they explained that they were changing their billing service and mistakenly showed a debt. They apologized for the mistake and the issue was resolved. I kept the bills and notes of who I called for another year before discarding them after it was evident this issue would not be revisited. The day I received the letter from Capio, I called and explained this. The agent could care less and threatened to report it to the credit bureaus. I told her I would not pay them for something I did not owe nor an extortion attempt. She became rude and I hung up on her. On XX/XX/2019 I received a notice from my credit check service at XXXX that they had reported this to XXXX and XXXX. After speaking with XXXX I had also found that they had illegaly re-aged the alleged debt. Disputes were filed with XXXX and XXXX XXXX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "5680   While checking my credit report I noticed Waypoint Resource Group has a negative remark on my reports stating that I owe a debt that I do not recognize. One entry was for 11 XXXX XXXX XXXX, and from my understanding that is a cable company. I have never used that company for cable service. I have never had cable service. This unverified information has caused a tremendous amount of stress and I plan to hire a credit protection lawyer to look into the matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "10805  On Saturday XX/XX/2019 I made an online payment to Synchrony Bank on their website. The minimum payment due was {$190.00}. On Monday XX/XX/2019 I discovered that Syncrony Bank charged my debit card {$2300.00}. I immediately called them to find out about the charge. They informed me that I would receive a refund minus the minimum payment in the mail in 3-4 weeks. On Tuesday XX/XX/2019 I called to follow up ensure the process was initiated. I was again told yes and in 3-4 weeks. I called Syncrony on  XX/XX/2019 to find out what date the check was mailed. After waiting for sometime on hold I was then told oh it was approved right now and will be mailed on XX/XX/2019. It should arrive in 7 days. On Monday possibly but for sure by the XXXX. This is unacceptable amount of time. I have other bills due, other banking issues due to overdrawn account. My credit union told me they will close my account if I do not return the amount of money Sychrony overdrew from my account by XX/XX/2019. \\nSyncrony Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX.

       "6193   Subject : Victim of Data Breach - Hurt, but more scared HOW my SSN was obtain/utilized without my knowledge/authorization.\\n\\nSince most of my knowledge is from the 19th century, and were currently in the 21th century, I do realize businesses have revolutionize their computer procedure over the years related to processing a Credit Application. I personally only know of 3 Consent Category to process a credit application for a credit cards, loans, etc.\\n\\n( 1 ) Consumers fill out a credit ( hard copy ) application with the consumers signature.\\n\\n( 2 ) Consumers consent to a ( recorded phone conversation ) for a credit application.\\n\\n( 3 ) Consumers consent to credit application by the way of the consumers electronic online signature or a Verbal Agreement between two parties on various devices ; such as POS Registers or  Tablets, etc., at that point, the consumers received Real-time approval. \\n\\nPlease read timeline Documents : XXXX XXXX dated XXXX, 3 XXXX XXXX XXXX Call logs XXXX and 1 XXXX XXXX XXXX Call log XXXX, 2 correspondences to XXXX dated XXXX, 1 Updated correspondence to XXXX dated XXXX, 1 correspondence to XXXX dated XXXX mailed, 1 correspondence to XXXX   dated XXXX mailed. Correspondence from XXXX and to XXXX of XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( ID XXXX ) and correspondence from and to XXXX : credit file XX/XX/2019, Confirmation # XXXX against Comenitybank/XXXX Mastercard There were NO exposure or authorization for a credit card application before, on, or after XXXX XXXX, to anybody from Comenitybank/XXXX store to utilize my SSN. I received my mail XX/XX/2019 and just found out from XXXX that I was supposed to have applied for a XXXX Mastercard. \\n\\nOn XXXX before XXXX XXXX to dated XXXX, I have not received a Credit Card rejection letter from Comenitybank/ XXXX   where I am supposed to have requested a credit card. However, Comenitybank/ XXXX wrote to XXXX after my first complaint to XXXX on XXXX. Message from Comenitybank : Inquiries are a factual record on file access SEE BACK UP Confirmation # XXXX, dated XXXX Today XXXX @ XXXX, I received a letter in the USPS mail box from Comenitybank . Their letter stated in part, they were unable to approve my application because they could not verify my SSN I provided in the application against information they obtain from the credit-reporting agency. I am confused because Comenitybank in fact did obtain my Social Security number and cause three negative impact : ( 1 ) A Hard Inquiry posted on XXXX which will stay on my credit report for 2 years and ( 2 ) A Hard Inquiry which caused my credit score to drop by 2 points ( 3 ) Both activity caused me extreme distress. The resolution : ( 1 ) I should receive {$500.00} compensation and ( 2 ) Comenity Bank need to delete the hard inquiry posted on my XXXX report.\\n\\nI have 2 Questions to Comenitybank/XXXX  : ( 1 ) Comenitybank/XXXX admitted in writing to XXXX  they have my information on file to access at will. Therefore, If I or a criminal give out correct but limited information EXCLUDING my social security number ( part/whole ) Comenitybank automatically thinks its XXXX XXXX and preform a Hard/Soft Inquiries for such items as a loan, mortgage, cars, credit cards, etc. Does Comenitybank/XXXX   have my signature on file next to my SSN to release information to all 3 credit bureaus? Which Consent Category do I fixed in above? I need to be compensated for extreme distress. \\n\\n( 2 ) In Comenitys letter dated XXXX, they told me my credit score as of XXXX which is additional proof they did obtain my correct SSN. I did not expose my SSN on XXXX to anyone nor asked for a credit application ; Who gave permission to have a Record on File Access to Comenitybank/XXXX? \\n\\nFinally, Comenity Bank has always had all my information including my SSN in their database for years, I can show proof. Its common sense, Comenity Bank would not be able to verify my Social Security number against the credit-reporting agency because as soon as I received the notification on my cell phone from XXXX XXXX early XXXX, I called instantly all 3 Credit bureau and asked them to put a Fraud Alert on my account because of the hard inquiry done XXXX with XXXX. SEE XXXX XXXX XXXX CALL LOGS. The hard inquiry dropped off on XXXX and XXXX. \\n\\nToday XXXX, I plan to USPS mail hard copies as back up, if the uploan do not work.                                                                                                                   \n",
       "52935  I paid off my Bank of America Master credit card for {$18000.00} on XX/XX/2020. On XX/XX/2020, I received the credit card statement for {$100.00}. I called the Bank of America ( BOA ) customer service to remove {$100.00} and she said the fee can't be removed. Furthermore, the customer representative didn't give a clear reason why I am being billed when I already paid off the credit card balance including the interest fee. \\n\\nThe Bank of America application payment page on a desktop computer is misleading and confusing. \\n\\n1. When I make a payment, the application didn't give me a chance to review my request before it submitted the payment.\\n\\n2. The application doesn't allow me to remove my bank information even there is no pending transaction.\\n\\n3. The application doesn't clearly show the payment statement.\\n\\n4. The email confirmation notification doesn't show the exact amount that was paid. The email displayed 'the minimum amount due, Amount Due, and Account Balance ''.\\n\\nI had to pay for {$100.00} so the Bank of America won't add more fees. I should not have been billed.\\n\\nI would like CFPB to look into these issues. I believe BOA is wrongly charged me and they aren't transparent with their charges, fees, their web application, and email notification for payment confirmation. \\n\\nThank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
